# AoC2022

My personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) puzzles using Java 17.0.4

Each day has a folder with the code (in general[^1] `Main.java`) and the test input from the problem statement (contained in `data/dummy.txt`).

## Testing the solutions

1. Make sure you have JDK 17.0.4 installed on your machine
2. Create a new file called `input.txt` in the `data` folder and copy your personal input there
3. Compile the project and run the `main` method from the `Main` class
